## 1. Sauerbraten

This is an aimbot (and info stealer) for a game called sauerbraten.

My initial good search yields

[sauerbraten](pics/sauerbraten.png)

So i assumed this was just a made up thing by the german FLARE team, and did most of it without the actual game until the last stage where i was kind of stuck and refined my search and found
[this](http://sauerbraten.org/).

Meanwhile i had to hunt for config files of softwares i dont own or even install them and bloated my VM with theses craps. I love snapshots...

practice your google search and don't assume you're getting trolled 24/7 by german gentlemen :) (even though you are).
