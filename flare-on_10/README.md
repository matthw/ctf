# Flare-On 10 "writeups"

These are quick & dirty writeups (such a big words) for the Flare-On 10 challenges.

I rushed a bit through the CTF because it's not like i can afford taking some vacation time to do it.

I'm also trying to stay in good terms with both my family and my employer, so I tried to go straight to the point and not spent my whole free time on it during a month and half.

That being said, i'm not going to spent another 2 weeks writing detailed solutions, some folks already did an amazing job at that:
- [jk42](https://twitter.com/jkfourtwo) goes into a [great deal of detail](https://github.com/jk45054/CTF-writeups/tree/main/Flare-On%2010)
- [Jesko HÃ¼ttenhain](https://twitter.com/huettenhain) wrote the [mandatory BinRef writeup](https://github.com/binref/refinery/blob/master/tutorials/tbr-files.v0x08.flare.on.10.ipynb) any (in)sane person was waiting for
- And of course the collection of [official solutions](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/flareon10-challenge-solutions)

You'll find here some quick writeups, cheesy solutions and somewhat low quality, cursed accompanying code - barely touched after getting the flags. The raw CTF experience :)
